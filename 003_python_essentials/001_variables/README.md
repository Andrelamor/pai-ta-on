# Variables

## Variables and Print

In this Python tutorial, you're going to learn about variables, which are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming.
They're not specific to Python and exist in pretty much every programming language out there.

We use variables to temporarily store data the computer's memory. Here's an example, let's type:

```Python
>>> price = 10
```

When the Python interpreter executes this code, it will allocate some memory, then it will store the number 10 in that memory, and finally, it will attach this price label in that memory location.
As a metaphor imagine we have a box.
In that box, we have the number 10, and the price is the label that we put on the box.
Now we can use this label anywhere in our program to access the value that we have in that box.
This is a very simplified explanation!

Let's use our brand new variable to print its value on the terminal:

```Python
>>> print(price)
```

In review, we'll see 10 on the terminal.

```Python
>>> price = 10
>>> print(price)
10
```

So this is how we define variables, we start with **an identifier which is the name of our variable**, then, an equal sign, and finally a value.
More accurately, when this number 10 is about to be stored in the memory, first it will get converted to this binary form presentation.
The number 10 is in the [decimal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal) which has all the digits from 0 to 9.
Computers don't understand these digits, they only understand [bynary sistem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number), which is a bunch of 0's and 1's.
So, to store the number 10 in the computerâ€™s memory first will get [converted to its binary](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-intro-to-algebra/algebra-alternate-number-bases/v/decimal-to-binary).

Taking this program to the next level. Updating the value of this price variable to a new value, like 20, we should see 20 printed, because the Python interpreter executes our code line by line from the top.

```Python
>>> price = 10
>>> price = 20
>>> print(price)
20
```

We set the price to 10, then we reset it to 20, and finally, we print it on the terminal.

So far, the numbers that we have until now are whole numbers without a decimal point.
In programming, we refer to these numbers as integers.
We can also use numbers with a decimal point. These kind of numbers are called the floating-point number, or float for short.

```Python
>>> rating = 4.9
>>> print(price)
4.9
```

Now we defined another variable called rating, but this time the float number 4.9 was assigned to it.

We can also define a variable and set it to a [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)), for example, name equals Paul.
In a very simplified way, in computer science, [strings](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zc6s4wx/revision/4#:~:text=Most%20programming%20languages%20have%20a,and%20characters%20may%20be%20repeated.&text=A%20string%20can%20be%20a%20constant%20or%20variable%20.) are ordered sequences of characters.

```Python
>>> name = 'Paul'
>>> print(name)
Paul
```

Above, the name variable was created and the value Paul was assigned to it.

We also have another kind of value called boolean which can be True or False. They are like yes and no in English. Below is an example. I'm going to define a variable, is_published and set it to True.

```Python
>>> is_published = True
>>> print(is_published)
True
```

Note that booleans must be capitalized.
Python will not understand if you spell it with a lowercase f r t an throw an error.

```Python
>>> is_published = true
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'true' is not defined
>>>
```

In summary, simple values can be numbers, which can be integers or floats, strings or booleans.
We can store complex values like lists and values, which we'll see in the future.

Before going any further, let's practice with a little exercise.
Imagine we're going to write a program for a record company to check on a singer named Paul McCartney.
He's 20 years old and he is a new singer.
I want you to define 3 variables.
One for storing his name, the other for his age, and the last one to inform if he is a new or an existing singer.

Before checking it out below try to do it yourself.

```Python
>>> name = "Paul McCartney"
>>> age = 20
>>> is_new_singer = True
>>> name
'Paul McCartney'
>>> age
20
>>> is_new_singer
True
```

## Input Functions

So far, you've learned how to print messages on the terminal window.
No, we're going to learn how to receive input from the user.
For that, we're going to write a small program that asks the user's name, and then we'll print a customized greeting message.

Both input and print are functions that are built into Python.
As a metaphor imagine the remote control of the TV.
On this remote control, we have a bunch of buttons.
These are the functions built into your tv, you can turn it on, turn it off, change the volume, and so on. In Python, we also have functions for common tasks such as printing messages, receiving input, etc.

See below how to call the input function. The parenthesis is used to call or execute the function, it's like pressing a button on the remote control.
Inside these parentheses, we want to add a string to print something on the terminal, let's say "What is your name? " (notice that the question mark is followed by a space).
The input function will print the message on the terminal, and then it will wait for the user to enter a value.

```Python
>>> input("What is your name? ")
What is your name?
```

The input function will return the user's answer and now we can store it in the memory using the variable, let's say, user_name.
We'll use the user_name variable to print a dynamic message like "Hi John, how is it going!".
To perform this we'll use plus signs in a technique called string concatenation.

```Python
user_name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hi " + user_name + ", how is it going!")
```

Above we have "Hi ", which is a string, concatenated or combined with another two strings, our user_name variable, and ", how is it going!".
In this expression (a piece of code that uses a value), we combined 3 strings.
Now note that earlier we added a space after the question mark, we did this, so in the terminal window the cursor to the user's answer is separated from the question mark, otherwise, it would be so close.

Now it's your turn to extend this program and ask two questions, the person's name, and their favorite color. Print a message like "John likes blue!".

Before checking it out below try to do it yourself.

```Python
user_name = input("What is your name? ")
favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
print(user_name + " likes " + favorite_color + "!")
```
